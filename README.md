## This is an event registration form that will collect general user registration details and is built using Laravel. It has also been validated. 

Laravel is a PHP framework that makes building web applications much easier and faster. 

An event registration form in Laravel can be created using HTML, CSS, and Laravel's built-in validation rules.

The form would collect the user's general data details such as name, email, phone number, date of birth, etc. 

The form data would then be validated by Laravel using its built-in validation rules.

Once the data is validated, it would be stored in a relational database, such as SQLite, for future use. 

The Laravel code would handle the creation and storage of the data in the database, making it easy to manage and access the data whenever it is needed to login to the system.
